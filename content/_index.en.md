With these graphs updated daily with **public official information** I show you:

* **{{< i18n "graphTitleActiveCases">}}**: Active cases per day, recovered and deaths. üëà this is the curve that we have to flatten. The active cases are the people that currently have the virus, calculated as the total cases minus the recovered and deaths.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleTotalCases">}}**: On each day, the total sum of confirmed cases up to that day.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleTotals">}}**: Comparison of the total cases registered so far: percentage of active cases, recovered and deaths.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleDailyCases">}}**: Number of tests carried out each day and how many of them were positive.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleDailyPositives">}}**: Of all the tests performed each day, what percentage of tests where positive on that day.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleTotalTests">}}**: Comparison of all tests performed so far: percentage of positives and negatives.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleHealthcareWorkers">}}**: Number of positive cases in each day and how many of them correspond to healthcare workers.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleHealthcareWorkersPercent">}}**: Of the positive cases of each day, what percentage corresponding to healthcare workers on that day.
* **{{< i18n "graphTitleDailyHospitalizations">}}**: Number of hospitalizations (intermediate care and intensive care) per day.

If you don't want to appear in these charts, **stay home**. If you don't want your loved ones to appear in these charts, **stay home**. If you don't want innocent people to appear in these charts, **stay home**.

üëâ **Stay home _when possible_**. Obviously some of us have to go out to work because we cannot do it remotely and all of us at some point need to go out, due to a need of force majeure. Everything else can wait.

**We are at war** against an invisible enemy. The only way to defeat it is by **working together**. Take care of yourself and others by informing yourself and following the official guidelines (in Uruguay): [Coronavirus National Plan][MSP_coronavirus].

## Why stay home?

* üò∑ We decrease the probability of infecting ourselves and infecting others.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è About 60% of people with coronavirus show mild or no symptoms. [[source][asymptomatic_cases]]
* üè• We help to **avoid overloading the health system** and therefore to **save lives**.

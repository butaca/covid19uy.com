With these graphs updated daily with **public official information** I show you:

If you can, **stay home**.

üëâ **Stay home _when possible_**. Obviously some of us have to go out to work because we cannot do it remotely and all of us at some point need to go out, due to a need of force majeure. Everything else can wait.

If you _have_ to go out, **keep 2 meters (~6.5 feet) away from other people** and **use a face mask** to protect yourself and others. According to new recommendations due to the new Omicron variant, ideally wear an N95 mask or similar, or a surgical mask under a cloth one. Avoid touching your face without washing your hands first. When you return home, **wash your hands** and disinfect everything you bring home and what you have touched before washing your hands.

**We are at war** against an invisible enemy. The only way to defeat it is by **working together**. Take care of yourself and others by informing yourself and following the official guidelines (in Uruguay): [Coronavirus National Plan][MSP_coronavirus].

## Why stay home?

* üò∑ We decrease the probability of infecting ourselves and infecting others.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è About 60% of people with coronavirus show mild or no symptoms. [[source][asymptomatic_cases]]
* üè• We help to **avoid overloading the health system** and therefore to **save lives**.

I invite you to try my [interactive coronavirus simulation][simulator] where you can visually see the impact of social distancing.

## How can I help?

First of all, it is super important that you follow the recommendations of the authorities and that you stay home as much as possible.

Download [**Coronavirus UY** (oficial MSP app, link on the bottom of the page)](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-salud-publica/coronavirus) and activate the exposure alerts if your device is compatible.

You can also collaborate with charitable foundations that are doing an outstanding effort:

With these graphs updated daily with **public official information** I show you:

* Active cases 👈 this is the curve that we have to flatten
* **Total cases** 😷 and **deaths** 😞
* Daily tests and daily positives
* Comparison of total, positive and negative tests
* Daily hospitalizations
* Comparison of total cases, active cases, recovered cases and deaths

If you don't want to appear in these charts, **stay home**. If you don't want your loved ones to appear in these charts, **stay home**. If you don't want innocent people to appear in these charts, **stay home**.

👉 **Stay home _when possible_**. Obviously some of us have to go out to work because we cannot do it remotely and all of us at some point need to go out, due to a need of force majeure. Everything else can wait.

**We are at war** against an invisible enemy. The only way to defeat it is by **working together**. Take care of yourself and others by informing yourself and following the official guidelines (in Uruguay): [Coronavirus National Plan][MSP_coronavirus].

## Why stay home?

* 😷 We decrease the probability of infecting ourselves and infecting others.
* ⚠️ About 60% of people with coronavirus show mild or no symptoms. [[source][asymptomatic_cases]]
* 🏥 We help to **avoid overloading the health system** and therefore to **save lives**.

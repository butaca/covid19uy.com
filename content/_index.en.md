With these graphs updated daily with **public official information** I show you:

If you don't want to appear in these charts, **stay home**. If you don't want your loved ones to appear in these charts, **stay home**. If you don't want innocent people to appear in these charts, **stay home**.

üëâ **Stay home _when possible_**. Obviously some of us have to go out to work because we cannot do it remotely and all of us at some point need to go out, due to a need of force majeure. Everything else can wait.

If you _have_ to go out, **keep 1.5 meters (~5 feet) away from other people** and **use a face mask** to protect yourself and others. You don't need to wear special face masks reserved for highly exposed people like healthcare workers. A strong, washable homemade fabric face mask is enough to cover your entire nose and mouth. When you return home, **wash your hands** and disinfect everything you bring home and what you have touched before washing your hands.

**We are at war** against an invisible enemy. The only way to defeat it is by **working together**. Take care of yourself and others by informing yourself and following the official guidelines (in Uruguay): [Coronavirus National Plan][MSP_coronavirus].

## Why stay home?

* üò∑ We decrease the probability of infecting ourselves and infecting others.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è About 60% of people with coronavirus show mild or no symptoms. [[source][asymptomatic_cases]]
* üè• We help to **avoid overloading the health system** and therefore to **save lives**.

## How can I help?

First of all, it is super important that you follow the recommendations of the authorities and that you stay home as much as possible.

Download [**Coronavirus UY** (oficial MSP app, link on the bottom of the page)](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-salud-publica/coronavirus) and activate the exposure alerts if your device is compatible.
